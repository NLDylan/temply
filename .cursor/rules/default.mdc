# 🧠 Cursor Rules — CV Builder Project

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project is a **CV Builder SaaS** built with **Laravel 12** and **Inertia.js (Vue 3)**.  
Users can **create beautiful CVs**, manage them for **1 year after a one-time payment**, and **download them as PDFs** after expiration (locked state).

The platform focuses on **simplicity, elegance, and performance**, powered by modern Laravel and Vue tooling.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### 🧩 Backend
- **Laravel 12**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **UUIDs** as primary keys for all models (use `Str::uuid()` or Laravel’s built-in UUID casting)
- **Spatie Media Library** for handling images, templates, and PDF exports
- **Spatie Permissions** for roles and access control (roles: `user`, `admin`)
- **Laravel Horizon** for managing queued jobs (PDF generation, notifications)
- **Laravel Herd** for local development
- **Laravel Boost** for production performance optimization
- **Queues / Jobs** for async PDF rendering (Browershot)

### 💻 Frontend
- **Inertia.js + Vue 3**
- **ShadCN Vue** for UI components and design consistency
- **TailwindCSS** for styling (use custom brand colors and responsive layouts)
- **Vue Router** handled by Inertia pages
- **Component structure:**
  - `resources/js/Pages/` → full pages
  - `resources/js/Components/` → reusable UI components
  - `resources/js/Layouts/` → shared layout (sidebar, navbar, etc.)

---

## 🎨 Design System

Use **ShadCN Vue** with **TailwindCSS** to create a cohesive and modern interface:
- **Sidebar layout** (like Notion / Framer style)
- **rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`)**
- **Font sizes:** `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-xl` for hierarchy
- **Primary color palette:** defined in Tailwind config (e.g., `brand`, `brand-foreground`)

2. **Templates**

   - After expiration:
     - CV is locked
     - User can only download their PDF
     - Option to renew access (extend 1 year)

4. **PDF Generation**
   - Use **Spatie Browsershot** for high-fidelity rendering
   - Processed asynchronously via **Jobs**
   - Saved to **Media Library** and linked to the user’s CV record

## 🧠 Development Guidelines

### Naming & Structure
- Use **PascalCase** for Vue components.
- Use **snake_case** for database columns.
- Use **Service Classes** for business logic (`App\Services\CV\CVBuilderService`).
- Use **Actions** for one-off tasks (`App\Actions\GenerateCVPdf`).
